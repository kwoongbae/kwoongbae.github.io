Thanks for visiting my website! 

I'm a Master student in Dept. of Industrial and Management Engineering at POSTECH. My research interests include integrating a **Deep Understanding of Finance** with **AI Development Capabilities** to explain financial phenomena from an engineering-oriented perspective. 
I'm currently research on systemic cyber risk and its modelling at [Actuarial modeling, Insurance and Risk Management (AIRM) Lab](https://airm.postech.ac.kr/), under the supervision of Prof. Kwangmin Jung.

You can see more detailed information via my [Curriculum Vitae (CV)](../assets/pdf/CV_K_Bae.pdf).
